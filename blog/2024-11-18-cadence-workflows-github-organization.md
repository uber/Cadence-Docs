We’re excited to announce that all Cadence GitHub repositories have been consolidated under the [cadence-workflow](https://github.com/cadence-workflow) organization! 🎉

Previously, Cadence repositories were distributed across multiple organizations at Uber: [`uber`](https://github.com/uber), [`uber-go`](https://github.com/uber-go), [`uber-common`](https://github.com/uber-common). To improve developer cohesiveness and simplify access, the Cadence Core team has migrated all open-source repositories to the [`cadence-workflow`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow) organization.

For example, our main repository has moved from:

👉 [uber/cadence](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence)

To its new home:

👉 [cadence-workflow/cadence](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence)

You can find the full list of Cadence repositories here 👉 [orgs/cadence-workflow/repositories](https://github.com/orgs/cadence-workflow/repositories)

This move reflects our continued commitment to growing the Cadence community and making the project even more accessible to contributors and users. Please update your bookmarks and links accordingly.

Thank you for being part of the Cadence journey! 🚀
