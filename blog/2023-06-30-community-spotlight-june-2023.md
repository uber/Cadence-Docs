We've had a short break but now we are back. Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!

Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

## Cadence Release 1.0 ##

Just in case you missed it - at the end of April [Cadence v1.0](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/releases/tag/v1.0.0) was officially released. This release is a significant milestone for the project and the community. It indicates that we are confident in the stability of the code that we can recommend it and promote it widely to more users. Kudos to everyone that worked together to make this release happen.

And the Uber team also gave Cadence a writeup on the [Uber Engineering Blog](https://www.uber.com/en-SE/blog/announcing-cadence/) so please take a look.

- Software Engineers featured highly as a community user profile
- Europe seems to be the most common community timezone
- People prefer using our Slack channel for questions
- Debugging is what most people need help with

Thank you to Ender for compiling the data and to  everyone who participated.

## Cadence Video Open Source Summit, North America ##
In May [Ender Demirkaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enderdemirkaya/) gave a talk called on Cadence at the Linux Foundation's [Open Source Summit, North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) in Vancouver. The presentation attracted a sizeable audience and was very well received. There was also a lot of questions from the audience which is a sign that Cadence sounded potentially useful to them.

A recording of the talk [Cadence: The New Open Source Project for Building Complex Distributed Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFPJlE6d4xs) is now available.

## Overcoming Potential Workflow Versioning Maintenance Challenges  ##

Community member [Quanzheng Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prclqz/) has written a [detailed article on Medium](https://medium.com/@qlong/how-to-overcome-some-maintenance-challenges-of-temporal-cadence-workflow-versioning-f893815dd18d) about some of the potential maintenance challenges of workflow versioning. It's a short read and has some good examples that explains the potential problems and identifies some approaches for dealing with them.

Thanks Long for sharing this knowledge with the community!
