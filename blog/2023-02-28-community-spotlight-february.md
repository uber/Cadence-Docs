Here’s the latest in our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!

Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

## Community Survey ##
We've been talking about doing a community survey for a while and during February we sent it out. We are still collating the results so it's not too late to send in your response.

The survey takes 5 minutes and is your opportunity to provide feedback to the project and highlight areas you think we need to focus on.

Use this [Survey Link](https://uber.surveymonkey.com/r/ZS83WJW)

Please take a few minutes to give us your opinion.

## Cadence and Temporal ##
During user surveys we've had a few queries about whether Cadence and [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) are the same project. The answer is No - they are not the same project but they do share the same origin. At a high level Temporal is a fork of the Cadence project. Both Temporal and Cadence are now being developed by different communities so are independent.

## Cadence at DoorDash ##
Although published a few months ago we missed including an article by [DoorDash](https://doordash.engineering/) about how they are using Cadence to build real time event processing with [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

Here is the link to the article: [Building Scalable Real Time Event Processing with Kafka and Flink](https://doordash.engineering/2022/08/02/building-scalable-real-time-event-processing-with-kafka-and-flink/)
