Are you a current Cadence user, do you operate Cadence services, or are you interested in learning about workflow technologies and wonder what problems Cadence could solve for you? We would like to talk to you!


Our team has spent a significant amount of time working with users and partner teams at Uber to design, scale and operate their workflows. This helps our users understand the technology better, smooth their learning curve and ramp up experience, and at the same time allows us to get fast and direct feedback so we can improve the developer experience and close feature gaps. As our product and community grows, we would like to expand this practice to our users in the OSS community. **For the first time ever, members of the Cadence team along with core contributors from the community will host bi-weekly office hours to answer any questions you have about Cadence, or workflow technology in general.** We can also dedicate future sessions to specific topics that have a common interest. Please don’t hesitate to let us know your thoughts.


Please join a session if you would like to talk about any of the following topics:
<ol>
<li>Understand what Cadence is and why it might be useful for you and your company</li>
<li>Guidance about running Cadence services and workers in production</li>
<li>Workflow design and operation consultation</li>
<li>Product update, future roadmaps as well as collaboration opportunities</li>
</ol>


Building and maintaining a healthy and growing community is the key to the success of Cadence, and one of the top priorities for our team. We would like to use the office hours as an opportunity to understand and help our customers, seek feedback, and forge partnerships. We look forward to seeing you in one of the meetings.


**Upcoming Office Hours**


As we have a geo-distributed userbase, we are still trying to figure out a time that works for most of the people. In the meanwhile, we will manually schedule the first few instances of the meeting until we settle on a fixed schedule. Our next office hours will take place on **Thursday, October 21 2pm-3pm PT/5pm-6pm EST/9pm-10pm GMT**. Please join via [this zoom link](https://uber.zoom.us/j/92356466350?pwd=RFVTc2pwV0xoVTdlK3VxN3N2eU5UZz09).
