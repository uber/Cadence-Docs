Welcome to our regular Cadence Community Spotlight update!

This is our monthly blog post series focused on news from in and around the Cadence community.

Please see below for a short activity roundup of what has happened recently in the community.

## Cadence Polling Cookbook

Do you want to understand polling work and have an example of how to set it up in Cadence? Well a brand new [Cadence Polling cookbook](https://info.instaclustr.com/rs/620-JHM-287/images/Cadence_Cookbook.pdf) is now available that gives you all the details you need. The cookbook was created by several members of the [Instaclustr](https://www.instaclustr.com/) team and they are keen to share it with the community. The pdf version of the cookbook can found on the Cadence website under  the *Polling an external API for a specific resource to become available* section of the [Polling Use cases](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/use-cases/polling/).

A [Github repository](https://github.com/instaclustr/cadence-cookbooks-instafood) has also been created with the sample cookbook code for you to try out for yourself.

So please go ahead and try out the cookbook and don’t forget to let us have your feedback.
