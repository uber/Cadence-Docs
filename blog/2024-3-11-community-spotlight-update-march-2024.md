Welcome back to the latest in our regular Cadence community spotlight updates where we aim to deliver you news from in and around the Cadence community!
It’s been a few months since our [last update](https://cadenceworkflow.io/blog/2023/11/30/community-spotlight-update-november-2023/), so I have a bunch of exciting updates to share.

Let’s get started!

## Proposal for Cadence Plugin System ##
Community member [Mantas Sidlauskas](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/mantassidlauskas) drafted a thorough proposal around putting together a plugin system in Cadence. Aimed at enhancing the flexibility of integrating various components like storage, document search, and archival, this system encourages the use of external plugins, promoting innovation and reducing dependency complications. Your insights and feedback are crucial; learn more and contribute your thoughts at the link below:

We're exploring various solutions and your participation would greatly influence the decision-making process. Feel free to chime in [here](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/issues/5683)!

## New Java Samples for Cadence: Signal Workflow Interactions ##
In some exciting news for Java enthusiasts, a new sample has been added to the Cadence Java Samples repository, demonstrating how to initiate and interact with a signal workflow using the Cadence client. This practical example is a huge win for developers looking to deepen their understanding of workflow signaling in Java.
