# Continue as new

:workflow:Workflows: that need to rerun periodically could naively be implemented as a big **for** loop with
a sleep where the entire logic of the :workflow: is inside the body of the **for** loop. The problem
with this approach is that the history for that :workflow: will keep growing to a point where it
reaches the maximum size enforced by the service.

[**ContinueAsNew**](https://www.javadoc.io/static/com.uber.cadence/cadence-client/2.7.9-alpha/com/cadence-workflow/cadence/workflow/Workflow.html#continueAsNew-java.lang.Object...-)
is the low level construct that enables implementing such :workflow:workflows: without the
risk of failures down the road. The operation atomically completes the current execution and starts
a new execution of the :workflow: with the same **:workflow_ID:**. The new execution will not carry
over any history from the old execution.

```java
@Override
public void greet(String name) {
  activities.greet("Hello " + name + "!");
  Workflow.continueAsNew(name);
}

```
