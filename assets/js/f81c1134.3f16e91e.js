We also want to make sure that losing a zone only affects a subset of workload, at most, rather than everything. However, in Cadence-based systems, the workload in a region is distributed randomly across all workers in the region at a \u201ctask-level granularity\u201d, which means a workflow may be worked on by any worker in the region where the domain is active. To achieve this goal, we introduced Zonal Isolation for Cadence Workflows - a feature designed to pin workflows to the zone they are started in, so that zonal isolation can be achieved at a workflow-level.\\n\\n## What is Zonal Isolation for Cadence Workflows?\\nAt high-level, Zonal Isolation for Cadence Workflows can be thought in 2 levels:\\n\\n1. **Task-level isolation:** All decision tasks and activity tasks of a workflow are only processed by workers from the zone where the workflow was started\\n2. **Infrastructure-level isolation:** Within a regional Cadence cluster, workflows are handled by server instances in the same zone where they were started, and the corresponding data is stored in that zone as well.\\n\\nInfrastructure-level isolation is quite challenging to implement as it requires significant changes to the core design of the Cadence server. Due to the complexity involved, support for this feature is not planned for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nAs a result, the focus remains on achieving task-level zonal isolation outside the Cadence server, which offers a more practical and immediate way to improve system resilience. It provides the capability of ensuring that an unhealthy zone (i.e. bad deployment of workers) only affect a subset of workflows (started from a certain zone) rather than every workflow in a Cadence domain.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## How Zonal Isolation Works in Cadence?\\n\\n### Architecture\\nHere is what the architecture of a zonally isolated Cadence-based system looks like:\\n![zonal isolation overview](./zone-isolation.png)\\n*<p>Fig: Workflows started in one zone are only dispatched to workers from the same zone. Colors to emphasize pinning.</p>*\\n### Implementation\\n\\n#### Determine the zone of a workflow and workers\\n\\nTo ensure that tasks are dispatched to workers in the same zone as the workflows, we must identify the origin zone of both. The zone of a workflow is determined by the origin zone of the StartWorkflowExecution request, while the zone of workers is determined by the origin zone of the PollForDecisionTask and PollForActivityTask requests. There are three possible ways to determine the origin zone for these requests:\\n\\n- **Uber\'s Approach:** Let Cadence SDK set the origin zone in the headers of the requests before sending the request to Cadence.\\n- **Preferred Approach:** Get the origin zone of the requests from headers set by network infrastructure.\\n- Determine the origin zone of the requests from the zone of the cadence-frontend instance receiving the request, if the network layer has already achieved zonal isolation.\\n\\nThe 2nd approach is the ideal one, but Uber\'s network infrastructure doesn\'t provide such headers and the network layer is not ready for zonal isolation. As a result, we adopt the 1st approach. At Uber, we have internal libraries in Go and Java acting as wrappers around Cadence SDK injecting necessary configurations. These libraries have been updated to include the origin zone in the request headers using a header called `cadence-client-isolation-group`.\\n\\n#### How to dispatch tasks to workers from the same zone?\\nTo implement task-level isolation, we introduce a new dimension to the tasklist \u2014 **isolation group**. When a workflow is initiated, the origin zone of the workflow is stored in the database. Each time a decision or activity task is dispatched to cadence-matching, the workflow\'s origin zone is used as the isolation group for that task.\\n\\nWhen a worker sends a `PollForDecisionTask` or `PollForActivityTask` request to cadence-matching, the request is labeled with the worker\'s isolation group (i.e., the worker\'s zone). Tasks are then dispatched only to poller requests that have the same isolation group, ensuring that tasks are processed by workers in the same zone as the workflow\'s origin.\\n#### How to handle workflows from a drained zone?\\nIn the event of an outage, such as a bad deployment, customers may want to drain workers from a specific zone to mitigate the impact. There are two types of drains that can occur:\\n1. **Implicit drain:** Workers from a zone completely stop operating, either due to failures or manual shutdowns.\\n2. **Explicit drain:** Customers explicitly mark workers from a zone as drained.\\n\\nWithin cadence-matching, a list of pollers is maintained for each tasklist, tracking the zone from which the pollers originate. An implicit drain can be detected by checking whether there are any active pollers from a particular zone. If a zone is drained (either explicitly or implicitly), workflows that were started in that zone will be reassigned and spread to workers in the remaining healthy zones.\\n##### How to drain a zone explicitly?\\nExplicitly draining a zone can be done at two levels:\\n1. **Domain-level drain:** This applies to a specific domain, allowing the zone to be drained only for workflows within that domain.\\n2. **Cluster-level drain:** This applies to the entire Cadence cluster, draining the zone for all domains and workflows within the cluster.\\n\\nFor domain-level drain, the draining status is stored in [`domains`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/v1.2.13/schema/cassandra/cadence/schema.cql#L412) table. For cluster-level drain, the status is stored in [`cluster_config`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/v1.2.13/schema/cassandra/cadence/schema.cql#L498) table.\\n\\n## How to enable Zonal Isolation?\\n### Server Update\\nIn order to enable this feature, please upgrade Cadence server to [v1.2.1](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/releases/tag/v1.2.1) or later.\\n\\n**NOTE:** If you\'re not using the provided main binary located in `cmd/server`, you must adopt this [middleware](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/v1.2.1/common/rpc/middleware.go#L188). Depends on the appoach to [determine the origin zone of requests](#determine-the-zone-of-a-workflow-and-workers), you can adopt this [middleware](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/v1.2.1/common/rpc/middleware.go#L229) or build your own middleware using [`partition.ContextWithConfig`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/v1.2.1/common/partition/context.go#L42) function to inject origin zone into the context.\\n\\nThis feature is controlled by 2 dynamic config properties.\\n- `system.allIsolationGroups`: This property provides the list of available zones within a region.\\n- `system.enableTasklistIsolation`: This property enables Zonal Isolation at domain level.\\nIt\u2019s important to note that any update to the `system.allIsolationGroups` property requires a restart of the cadence-matching service for the changes to take effect. This ensures that the new zone configuration is properly loaded and applied. However, the `system.enableTasklistIsolation` property can be updated dynamically without requiring a restart, making it more flexible for enabling or disabling Zonal Isolation on a per-domain basis.\\n\\nAn example configuration using the file based dynamic configuration could look like this:\\n```yaml\\nsystem.allIsolationGroups:\\n- value: []\\n  constraints: {}\\n- value: [\\"dca1\\", \\"dca2\\", \\"dca3\\"]\\n  constraints:\\n    clusterName: prod-dca\\n- value: [\\"phx1\\", \\"phx2\\", \\"phx3\\"]\\n  constraints:\\n    clusterName: prod-phx\\nsystem.enableTasklistIsolation:\\n- value: false\\n  constraints: {}\\n- value: true\\n  constraints:\\n    domainName: samples-domain\\n```\\nIn this example, the Cadence cluster spans two regions, each containing three zones: `dca1`, `dca2`, `dca3` in the `dca` region and `phx1`, `phx2`, `phx3` in the `phx` region. Zonal isolation is enabled only for the `samples-domain`, while it remains disabled for other domains.\\n\\n### SDK Update\\nNOTE: This update is only necessary if you\'re using the 1st approach to [determine the origin zone of requests](#determine-the-zone-of-a-workflow-and-workers).\\n\\nTo support Zonal Isolation, please upgrade your SDK versions:\\n- **Go SDK:** Upgrade to [v1.0.2](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-go-client/releases/tag/v1.0.2) or later.\\n- **Java SDK:** Upgrade to [v3.9.0](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-client/releases/tag/v3.9.0) or later.\\n\\n**For Java SDK users**, set the [`isolationGroup`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-client/blob/v3.9.0/src/main/java/com/uber/cadence/serviceclient/ClientOptions.java#L83) field to the zone of the instance when creating `serviceClient`.\\n\\n**For Go SDK users**, set the [`isolationGroup`](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-go-client/blob/v1.0.2/internal/worker.go#L132) field to the zone of the instance when creating `Worker`. Additionally, you need to use [this method](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-go-client/blob/v1.0.2/isolationgroup/wrapper.go#L29C39-L29C70) to wrap `workflowserviceclient.Interface`.\\n## How to drain a zone explicitly?\\nDrains can be done via the [Admin APIs](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-idl/blob/50a4ee241e50c6baab8e5d47540b176c5ee022a4/proto/cadence-workflow/cadence/admin/v1/service.proto#L125) of cadence-frontend or CLI.\\n\\nYou can check the help message for the CLI by running:\\n```bash\\ncadence admin isolation-groups -h\\n```\\n## Monitoring\\nA new metric is introduced to help detect the leakage of tasks and skewness of traffic.\\n\\n`isolation_task_matches_per_tl`: This is a counter that counts the number of tasks polled by workers. The metric is tagged with the domain, tasklist name, tasklist type, the origin zone of the workflow and the origin zone of the worker polling the task.\\n\\nThis metric can be used in the following ways:\\n\\n**Detecting task leakage:** By grouping tasks based on the origin zones of both the workflows and workers, you can identify tasks that have leaked, i.e., tasks assigned to workers in zones different from the workflow\'s origin zone.\\n\\n**Identifying traffic skewness:** By grouping tasks based solely on the origin zones of workflows, you can determine if traffic is disproportionately distributed among the zones, helping to detect any uneven load or traffic imbalance across zones.\\n\\n## Status at Uber\\n- We launched this feature at Uber in July 2023. More than 100 domains have Zonal Isolation enabled.\\n- However, as of 2024, the rollout of Zonal Isolation is paused due to a traffic skewness issue:\\n  - Some customers have highly skewed traffic that some zones have more workflows than other zones, but the number of workers are evenly distributed in all zones. Enabling Zonal Isolation for the customers will decrease the utilization of their workers and may cause high latency for the customers.\\n\\n## Next Step\\nCurrently, Zonal Isolation is implemented as **hard isolation**, where tasks are strictly limited to the same zone as the originating workflow. To address the traffic skewness issue, we are working on iterating this feature to introduce **soft isolation**. This relaxed version will allow for some task leakage between zones if traffic skewness is detected, ensuring better worker utilization and reducing latency.\\n\\nThis enhancement is one of our major ongoing projects, and we plan to share more details in a future blog post once it is launched."},{"id":"/2024/10/01/announcing-cadence-helm-charts-v0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/10/01/announcing-cadence-helm-charts-v0","editUrl":"https://github.com/cadence-workflow/Cadence-Docs/tree/master/blog/2024-10-01-announcing-cadence-helm-charts-v0.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-01-announcing-cadence-helm-charts-v0.md","title":"Announcement: Cadence Helm Charts v0 Release","description":"We\u2019ve heard your feedback: deploying Cadence has been a challenge, especially with limited documentation on operational aspects.

This will be the starting point for standardizing Cadence deployments on Kubernetes. We chose Kubernetes because it\'s the leading compute platform, but Cadence remains flexible and can run on any infrastructure.\\n\\n## How to Get Started\\n\\n[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to Helm\'s [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.\\n\\nOnce Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\nhelm repo add cadence https://uber.github.io/cadence-charts\\n```\\n\\nIf you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo cadence` to see the charts.\\n\\nTo install the cadence chart:\\n```bash\\nhelm install my-cadence cadence/cadence\\n```\\n\\nTo uninstall the chart:\\n```bash\\nhelm delete my-cadence\\n```\\n\\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to validate the deployment by running sample workflows.\\n\\n## Current State of the Chart\\n\\nThere were a few community-created Cadence Helm charts but they were not actively maintained and had a few glitches that Cadence team @Uber wasn\'t able to provide support for. With the introduction of the new official Cadence Helm chart, our team is committed to provide support and evolve it with input from community.\\n\\nThe v0 chart contains only the basics at the moment:\\n- Cadence backend services as separate deployments: frontend, history, matching, worker.\\n- Customizable replica counts and resource limitations.\\n- Customizable dynamic config as a configmap.\\n- A single instance ephemeral Cassandra container. This is included so that no external dependency is required to get started. Ideally you should have your own external (hosted or managed) DB instance that you can specify in values.yaml.\\n- The chart comes with `cadence:master-auto-setup` as the default image and capable of setting up Cassandra DB schema on first installation.\\n\\nWhat is (obviously) missing:\\n- Support for advanced visibility stores like Elasticsearch or Pinot.\\n- Support for persistent plugins configurations besides Cassandra.\\n- Support for fully customizable service config via values.yaml.\\n- Metrics integration with Prometheus (and more out of the box prometheus dashboards)\\n- Custom annotations/lables/tolerations etc.\\n- Support for ingress\\n\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nSince this is an early release, we would love to hear from you. Feel free to start [discussions](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts/discussions) or report [issues](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts/issues).\\n\\nAlso check out the [contribution guideline](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-charts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested to contribute.

The clusters being multi-tenant means potential [noisy neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_issues#Performance_interference_and_noisy_neighbors) effects between domains.\\n\\nAn essential aspect of avoiding this is managing how workflows interact with our infrastructure to prevent any single workflow from causing instability for the whole cluster. To this end, we are excited to introduce Workflow ID-based rate limits \u2014 a new feature designed to protect our clusters from problematic workflows and ensure stability across the board.\\n\\n## Why Workflow ID-based Rate Limits?\\nWe already have rate limits for how many requests can be sent to a domain. However, since Cadence is sharded on the workflow ID, a user-provided input, an overused workflow with a particular id might overwhelm a shard by making too many requests. There are two main ways this happens:\\n\\n1. A user starts, or signals the same workflow ID too aggressively,\\n2. A workflow starts too many activities over a short period of time (e.g. thousands of activities in seconds).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFor example, the following workflow would cause issues for Cadence. It would create huge amounts of traffic to a single shard in a very small time frame:\\n\\n```go\\nfunc Workflow(ctx workflow.Context, input sampleInput) (string, error) {\\n\\t...\\n\\tfor _, elem := range longList {\\n\\t\\terr := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, QuickActivity, elem).Get(ctx, nil)\\n\\t}\\n\\t...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis heavy load creates what we call _hot shards_. Hot shards degrade performance not just for the workflow causing the issue, but for all workflows that interact with the affected shard. This can grow to a point where the whole cluster becomes unstable.\\n\\nNow, with Workflow ID-based rate limits, we limit the number of external calls and actions per second for each individual workflow, reducing the blast radius (impact on the cluster) of a badly behaved workflow to an absolute minimum where only the offending workflow is impacted.\\n\\n## Why _not_ Shard Rate Limits?\\n\\nAn obvious question is \u201cwhy don\u2019t we rate limit the requests to the shard?\u201d. After all, the shard is what we want to protect. We have several reasons for choosing to rate limit the workflow ID instead of the shard:\\n\\n- __Hashing__ The workflow ID to shard is random. This means that rate limiting a workflow is a good proxy for rate limiting a shard. The likelihood that many requests from different workflows hit the same shard is very low.\\n- __Communication__ It is easy to explain to a user that their domain is rate limited because they are sending too many requests to a specific workflow ID. Shards are an internal implementation detail that users should not have to worry about.\\n- __Noisy neighbors__ Shards are shared across the different domains in a Cadence cluster. If a user is sending too many requests to a shard, we would choose to rate limit requests to that shard. Since other users in other domains are also using the shard, they will also be rate limited.\\nRate limiting users of a healthy domain because of requests from a completely different domain goes against the isolation the domains are meant to ensure.\\n\\n## How Does It Work?\\nWorkflow ID-based rate limits are set for all workflow IDs in a domain. If the external limit for a domain is e.g. set to 100 it means that any single workflow ID in that domain can at most be signaled 100 times a second. The rate limits are implemented in two main areas:\\n\\n1. __External Calls__ Cadence limits the number of requests per second for each workflow ID, which includes operations like starting, querying, or signaling a workflow. If this limit is exceeded, a ServiceBusyError with message \u201cToo many requests for the workflow ID\u201d is triggered, indicating that the rate limit for the workflow has been reached.\\n\\n2. __Actions Within a Workflow__ This limit controls the number of tasks processed per second within a workflow, focusing on managing decision tasks and activity tasks. When these limits are reached, Cadence slows down task processing without requiring any intervention from the user, though they might notice an increase in task execution time, eventually causing timeouts.\\n\\n### How do I Enable It?\\n\\nThe limits are controlled using six dynamic config properties, three for the internal limits, and a corresponding three for the external limits, all with a domain filter, so the limits can be controlled for each domain.\\n\\n- history.workflowIDCacheInternalEnabled\\\\\\n  history.workflowIDCacheExternalEnabled\\n    - Controls if the statistics needed to do the rate limiting should be collected. The feature keeps an in-memory record in the history service for each workflow ID.\\n- history.workflowIDInternalRPS\\\\\\n  history.workflowIDExternalRPS\\n    - Sets the number of requests allowed per second per workflow in a particular domain.\\n- history.workflowIDExternalRateLimitEnabled\\\\\\n  history.workflowIDInternalRateLimitEnabled\\n    - Set whether rate limiting should happen. Setting this to false allows us to see which domains _would have_ been rate limited and adjust them before enforcing the limits.\\n\\nAn example configuration using the file based dynamic configuration could look like this:\\n\\n```yaml\\nhistory.workflowIDCacheExternalEnabled:\\n- value: true\\n  constraints: {}\\nhistory.workflowIDExternalRateLimitEnabled:\\n- value: false\\n  constraints:\\n    domainName: samples-domain\\n- value: true\\n  constraints: {}\\nhistory.workflowIDExternalRPS:\\n- value: 100\\n  constraints: {}\\n```\\n\\nHere only the external rate limits are enabled. The internal rate limits have the same structure. We see that \u200cthe rate limiting is enabled for all domains, with a max RPS of 100. The domain samples-domain is however running in shadow mode, so its requests are not rate limited, but metrics and logs are still emitted.\\n\\nThe exact RPS to set for a specific domain and cluster, depends on many things, such as the number of shards, the selected persistent layer, the general load on the cluster etc.\\n\\n## Monitoring and Troubleshooting\\n\\nThe new feature introduces both new metrics and new logs. The new logs help us find workflows that are being rate limited, while the new metrics let us see if domains are being rate limited, and how close to being rate limited they are.\\n\\nThere are four new metrics, two for internal limits and two corresponding metrics for external limits, all emitted from history.\\n\\n- workflow_id_external_requests_ratelimited\\\\\\n  workflow_id_internal_requests_ratelimited\\n    - This is a counter that counts the number of rate limited requests. The metric is tagged with the domain, so we can track the rate limiting per domain.\\n- workflow_id_external_requests_max_requests_per_second\\\\\\n  workflow_id_internal_requests_max_requests_per_second\\n    - This is a timer metric. The upper series gives the max number of requests to a single workflow ID. This is again tagged with the domain, so we can for each domain see how close its workflows are to the limit.\\n\\nThese metrics let us monitor and alert on the new rate limits. Additionally, when breaking a rate limit, the history service will emit an info log with the message \u201cRate limiting workflowID\u201d, these logs are tagged with the workflowID that is being limited, so it is easy to find the offending workflow. An example log would look like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\"level\\":\\"info\\",\\n    \\"ts\\":\\"2024-09-02T08:47:12.843Z\\",\\n    \\"msg\\":\\"Rate limiting workflowID\\",\\n    \\"service\\":\\"cadence-history\\",\\n    \\"request-type\\":\\"external\\",\\n    \\"wf-domain-id\\":\\"fc0c7fcb-5796-4c80-b0d7-10bbbc66614e\\",\\n    \\"wf-domain-name\\":\\"samples-domain\\",\\n    \\"wf-id\\":\\"test\\",\\n    \\"logging-call-at\\":\\"cache.go:175\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nImplementing these rate limits highly improves the reliability of a Cadence cluster, as users now cannot send too many requests to a single shard. This fine-grained control helps in maintaining optimal performance and enhances the ability to forecast and mitigate potential issues before they impact the service.\\n\\nWorkflow ID-based rate limits are a significant step forward in our ongoing effort to provide a robust and efficient workflow management service. By preventing hot shards and ensuring equitable resource distribution, we can offer more reliable performance, even under peak loads. We encourage all Cadence users to familiarize themselves with these new limits and adjust their workflow configurations to achieve optimal results."},{"id":"/2024/07/11/2024-07-11-yearly-roadmap-update/yearly-roadmap-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/07/11/2024-07-11-yearly-roadmap-update/yearly-roadmap-update","editUrl":"https://github.com/cadence-workflow/Cadence-Docs/tree/master/blog/2024-07-11-yearly-roadmap-update/2024-07-11-yearly-roadmap-update.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-11-yearly-roadmap-update/2024-07-11-yearly-roadmap-update.md","title":"2024 Cadence Yearly Roadmap Update","description":"Introduction","date":"2024-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Roadmap","permalink":"/blog/tags/roadmap","description":"Roadmap tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Deep Dives","permalink":"/blog/tags/deep-dives","description":"Deep Dives tag description"}],"readingTime":16.31,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ender Demirkaya","title":"Senior Manager at Uber, Cadence.

In a short description, Cadence is a code-driven workflow orchestration engine. The definition itself may not tell enough, so it would help splitting it into three parts:\\n\\n* What\u2019s a workflow? (everyone has a different definition)\\n* Why does it matter to be code-driven?\\n* Benefits of Cadence\\n\\n### What is a Workflow?\\n\\n![workflow.png](./2024-yearly-update/workflow.png)\\n\\nIn the simplest definition, it is \u201ca multi-step execution\u201d. Step here represents individual operations that are a little heavier than small in-process function calls. Although they are not limited to those: it could be a separate service call, processing a large dataset, map-reduce, thread sleep, scheduling next run, waiting for an external input, starting a sub workflow etc. It\u2019s anything a user thinks as a single unit of logic in their code. Those steps often have dependencies among themselves. Some steps, including the very first step, might require external triggers (e.g. button click) or schedules. In the more broader meaning, any multi-step function or service is a workflow in principle.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWhile the above is a more correct way to define workflows, specialized workflows are more widely known: such as data pipelines, directed acyclic graphs, state machines, cron jobs, (micro)service orchestration, etc. This is why typically everyone has a different workflow meaning in mind. Specialized workflows also have simplified interfaces such as UI, configs or a DSL (domain specific language) to make it easy to express the workflow definition.\\n\\n### Code-Driven Workflows\\n\\nOver time, any workflow interface evolves to support more scenarios. For any non-code  (UI, config, DSL) technology, this means more APIs, concepts and tooling. However, eventually, the technology\u2019s capabilities will be limited by its interface itself. Otherwise the interface will get more complicated to operate.\\n\\nWhat happens here is users love the seamless way of creating workflow applications and try to fit more scenarios into it. Natural user tendency is to be able to write any program with such simplicity and confidence.\\n\\nGiven this natural evolution of workflow requirements, it\u2019s better to have a code-driven workflow orchestration engine that can meet any future needs with its powerful expressiveness. On top of this, it is ideal if the interface is seamless, where engineers learn as little as possible and change almost nothing in their local code to write a distributed and durable workflow code. This would virtually remove any limitation and enable implementing any service as a workflow. This is what Cadence aims for.\\n\\n### Benefits\\n\\n![cadence-benefits.png](./2024-yearly-update/cadence-benefits.png)\\n\\nWith Cadence, many overheads that need to be built for any well-supported service come for free. Here are some highlights (see [cadenceworkflow.io](http://cadenceworkflow.io)):\\n\\n* Disaster recovery is supported by default through data replication and failovers\\n* Strong multi tenancy support in Cadence clusters. Capacity and traffic management.\\n* Users can use Cadence APIs to start and interact with their workflows instead of writing new APIs for them\\n* They can schedule their workflows (distributed cron, scheduled start) or any step in their workflows\\n* They have tooling to get updates or cancel their workflows.\\n* Cadence comes with default metrics and logging support so users already get great insights about their workflows without implementing any observability tooling.\\n* Cadence has a web UI where users can list and filter their workflows, inspect workflow/activity inputs and outputs.\\n* They can scale their service just like true stateless services even though their workflows maintain a certain state.\\n* Behavior on failure modes can easily be configured with a few lines, providing high reliability.\\n* With Cadence testing capabilities, they can write unit tests or test against production data to prevent backward incompatibility issues.\\n* \u2026\\n\\n## Project Support\\n\\n### Team\\n\\nToday the Cadence team comprises 26 people. We have people working from Uber\u2019s US offices (Seattle, San Francisco and Sunnyvale) as well as Europe offices (Aarhus-DK and Amsterdam-NL).\\n\\n### Community\\n\\nCadence is an actively built open source project. We invest in both our internal and open source community ([Slack](http://t.uber.com/cadence-slack), [Github](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/issues)), responding to new features and enhancements.\\n\\n### Scale\\n\\nIt\u2019s one of the most popular platforms at Uber executing ~100K workflow updates per second. There are about 30 different Cadence clusters, several of which serve hundreds of domains. There are ~1000 domains (use cases) varying from tier 0 (most critical) to tier 5 scenarios.\\n\\n### Managed Solutions\\n\\nWhile Uber doesn\u2019t officially sell a managed Cadence solution, there are companies (e.g. [Instaclustr](https://www.instaclustr.com/platform/managed-cadence/)) in our community that we work closely with selling Managed Cadence. Due to efficiency investments and other factors, it\u2019s significantly cheaper than its competitors. It can be run in users\u2019 on-prem machines or their cloud service of choice. Pricing is defined based on allocated hosts instead of number of requests so users can get more with the same resources by utilizing multi-tenant clusters.\\n\\n## After V1 Release\\n\\nLast year, around this time we announced [Cadence V1](https://www.uber.com/blog/announcing-cadence/) and shared our roadmap. In this section we will talk about updates since then. At a high level, you will notice that we continue investing in high reliability and efficiency while also developing new features.\\n\\n### Frequent Releases\\n\\nWe announced plans to make more frequent releases last year and started making more frequent releases. Today we aim to release biweekly and sometimes release as frequently as weekly. About the format, we listened to our community and heard about having too frequent releases potentially being painful. Therefore, we decided to increment the patch version with releases while incrementing the minor version close to quarterly. This helped us ship much more robust releases and improved our reliability. Here are some highlights:\\n\\n### Zonal Isolation\\n\\nCadence clusters have already been regionally isolated until this change. However, in the cloud, inter-zone communications matter as they are more expensive and their latencies are higher. Zones can individually have problems without impacting other cloud zones. In a regional architecture, a single zone problem might impact every request; however, with zonal isolation traffic from a zone with issues can easily be failed over to other zones, eliminating its impact on the whole cluster. Therefore, we implemented zonal isolation keeping domain traffic inside a single zone to help improve efficiency and reliability.\\n\\n### Narrowing Blast Radius\\n\\nWhen there are issues in a Cadence cluster, it\u2019s often from a single misbehaving workflow. When this happens the whole domain or the cluster could have had issues until the specific workflow is addressed. With this change, we are able to contain the issue only to the offending workflow without impacting others. This is the narrowest blast radius possible.\\n\\n### Async APIs\\n\\nAt Uber, there are many batch work streams that run a high number of workflows (thousands to millions) at the same time causing bottlenecks for Cadence clusters, causing noisy neighbor issues. This is because StartWorkflow and SignalWorkflow APIs are synchronous, which means when Cadence acks the user requests are successfully saved in their workflow history.\\n\\nEven after successful initiations, users would then need to deal with high concurrency. This often means constant worker cache thrashing, followed by history rebuilds at every update, increasing workflow execution complexity to O(n^2) from O(n). Alternatively, they would need to quickly scale out and down their service hosts in a very short amount of time to avoid this.\\n\\nWhen we took a step back and analyzed such scenarios, we realized that users simply wanted to \u201ccomplete N workflows (jobs) in K time\u201d. The guarantees around starts and signals were not really important for their use cases. Therefore, we implemented async versions of our sync API, by which we can control the consumption rate, guaranteeing the fastest execution with no disruption in the cluster.\\n\\nLater this year, we plan to expand this feature to cron workflows and timers as well.\\n\\n### Pinot as Visibility Store\\n\\n[Apache Pinot](https://pinot.apache.org/) is becoming popular due to its cost efficient nature. Several teams reported significant savings by changing their observability storage to Pinot. Cadence now has a Pinot plugin for its visibility store. We are still rolling out this change. Latencies and cost savings will be shared later.\\n\\n### Code Coverage\\n\\nWe have received many requests from our community to actively contribute to our codebase, especially after our V1 release. While we have been already collaborating with some companies, this is a challenge with individuals who are just learning about Cadence. One of the main reasons was to avoid bugs that can be introduced.\\n\\nWhile Cadence has many integration tests, its unit test coverage was lower than desired. With better unit test coverage we can catch changes that break previous logic and prevent them getting into the main branch. Our team covered additional 50K+ lines in various Cadence repos. We hope to bring our code coverage to 85%+ by the end of year so we can welcome such inquiries a lot easier.\\n\\n### Replayer Improvements\\n\\nThis is still an ongoing project. As mentioned in our V1 release, we are revisiting some core parts of Cadence where less-than-ideal architectural decisions were made in the past. Replayer/shadower is one of such parts. We have been working on improving its precision, eliminating false negatives and positives.\\n\\n### Global Rate Limiters\\n\\nCadence rate limiters are equally distributed across zones and hosts. However, when the user\'s traffic is skewed, rate limits can get activated even though the user has more capacity. To avoid this, we built global rate limiters. This will make rate limits much more predictable and capacity management a lot easier.\\n\\n### Regular Failover Drills\\n\\nCadence has been performing monthly regional and zonal failover drills to ensure its failover operations are working properly in case we need it. We are failing over hundreds of domains at the same time to validate the scale of this operation, capacity elasticity and correctness of workflows.\\n\\n### Cadence Web v4\\n\\nWe are migrating Cadence web from Vue.js to React.js to use a more modern infrastructure and to have better feature velocity. We are about 70% complete with this migration and hope to release the new version of it soon.\\n\\n### Code Review Time Non-determinism Checks\\n\\n(This is an internal-only feature that we hope to release soon) Cadence non-determinism errors and versioning were common pain points for our customers. There are available tools but they require ongoing effort to validate. We have built a tool that generates a shadower test with a single line command (one time only operation) and continuously validates any code change against production data.\\n\\nThis feature reduced the detect-and-fix time from days/weeks to minutes. Just by launching this feature to the domains with the most non-determinism errors, the number of related incidents reduced by 40%. We have already blocked 500+ diffs that would potentially impact production negatively. This boosted our users\u2019 confidence in using Cadence.\\n\\n### Domain Reports\\n\\n(This is an internal-only feature that we hope to release soon) We are able to detect potential issues (bugs, antipatterns, inefficiencies, failures) with domains upon manual investigation. We have automated this process and now generate reports for each domain. This information can be accessed historically (to see the progression over time) and on-demand (to see the current state). This has already driven domain reliability and efficiency improvements.\\n\\nThis feature and above are at MVP level where we plan to generalize, expand and release for open source soon. In the V1 release, we have mentioned that we would build certain features internally first to be able to have enough velocity, to see where they are going and to make breaking changes until it\u2019s mature.\\n\\n### Client Based Migrations\\n\\nWith 30 clusters and ~1000 domains in production, migrating a domain from a cluster to another became a somewhat frequent operation for Cadence. While this feature is mostly automated, we would like to fully automate it to a level that this would be a single click or command operation. Client based migrations (as opposed to server based ones) give us big flexibility that we can have migrations from many to many environments at the same time. Each migration happens in isolation without impacting any other domain or the cluster.\\n\\nThis is an ongoing project where remaining parts are migrating long running workflows faster and seamless technology to technology migrations even if the \u201cfrom-technology\u201d is not Cadence in the first place. There are many users that migrated from Cadence-like or different technologies to Cadence so we hope to remove the repeating overhead for such users.\\n\\n## Roadmap (Next Year)\\n\\nOur priorities for next year look similar with reliability, efficiency, and new features as our focus. We have seen significant improvements especially in our users\u2019 reliability and efficiency on top of the improvements in our servers. This both reduces operational load on our users and makes Cadence one step closer to being a standard way to build services. Here is a short list of what\'s coming over the next 12 months:\\n\\n### Database efficiency\\n\\nWe are increasing our investment in improving Cadence\u2019s database usage. Even though Cadence\u2019s cost looks a lot better compared to the same family of technologies, it can still be significantly improved by eliminating certain bottlenecks coming from its original design.\\n\\n### Helm Charts\\n\\nWe are grateful to the Cadence community for introducing and maintaining our Helm charts for operating Cadence clusters. We are taking its ownership so it can be officially released and tested. We expect to release this in 2024.\\n\\n### Dashboard Templates\\n\\nDuring our tech talks, demos and user talks, we have received inquiries about what metrics care about. We plan to release templates for our dashboards so our community would look at a similar picture.\\n\\n### Client V2 Modernization\\n\\nAs we announced last year that we plan to make breaking changes to significantly improve our interfaces, we are working on modernizing our client interface.\\n\\n### Higher Parallelization and Prioritization in Task Processing\\n\\nIn an effort to have better domain prioritization in multitenant Cadence clusters, we are improving our task processing with higher parallelization and better prioritization. This is a lot better model than just having domains with defined limits. We expect to provide more resources to high priority domains during their peak hours while allowing low priority domains to consume much bigger resources than allocated during quiet times.\\n\\n### Timer and Cron Burst Handling\\n\\nAfter addressing start and signal burst scenarios, we are continuing with bursty timers and cron jobs. Many users set their schedules and timers for the same second with the intention of being able to finish N jobs within a certain amount of time. Current scheduling design isn\u2019t friendly for such intents and high loads can cause temporary starvation in the cluster. By introducing better batch scheduling support, clusters can continue with no disruption while timers are processed in the most efficient way.\\n\\n### High zonal skew handling\\n\\nFor users operating in their own cloud and having multiple independent zones in every region, zonal skews can be a problem and can create unnecessary bottlenecks when Zonal Isolation feature is enabled. We are working on addressing such issues to improve task matching across zones when skew is detected.\\n\\n### Tasklist Improvements\\n\\nWhen a user scenario grows, there are many knobs that need to be manually adjusted. We would like to automatically partition and smartly forward tasks to improve tasklist efficiency significantly to avoid backlogs, timeouts and hot shards.\\n\\n### Shard Movement/Assignment Improvements\\n\\nCadence shard movements are based on consistent hash and this can be a limiting factor for many different reasons. Certain hosts can end up getting unlucky by having many shards, or having heavy shards. During deployments we might observe a much higher number of shard movements than desired, which reduces the availability. With improved shard movements and assignments we can have more homogenous load among hosts while also having a minimum amount of shard movements during deployments with much better availability.\\n\\n### Worker Heartbeats\\n\\nToday, there\u2019s no worker liveliness tracking in Cadence. Instead, task or activity heartbeat timeouts are used to reassign tasks to different workers. For latency sensitive users this can become a big disruption. For long activities without heartbeats, this can cause big delays. This feature is to eliminate depending on manual timeout or heartbeat configs to reassign tasks by tracking if workers are still healthy. This feature will also enable so many other new efficiency and reliability features we would like to get to in the future.\\n\\n### Domain and Workflow Diagnostics\\n\\nProbably the two most common user questions are \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my domain?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my workflow?\u201d. Today, diagnosing what happened and what could be wrong isn\u2019t that easy apart from some basic cases. We are working on tools that would run diagnostics on workflows and domains to point out things that might potentially be wrong with public runbook links attached. This feature will not only help diagnose what is wrong with our workflows and domains but will also help fix them.\\n\\n### Self Serve Operations\\n\\nCertain Cadence operations are performed through admin CLI operations. However, these should be able to be done via Cadence UI by users. Admins shouldn\u2019t need to be involved in every step or the checks they validate should be able to be automated. This is what the initiative is about including domain registration, auth/authz onboarding or adding new search attributes but it\u2019s not limited to these operations.\\n\\n### Cost Estimation\\n\\nOne big question we receive when users are onboarding to Cadence is \u201cHow much will this cost me?\u201d. This is not an easy question to answer since data and traffic load can be quite different. We plan to automate this process to help users understand how much resources they will need. Especially in multi-tenant clusters, this will help users understand how much room they still have in their clusters and how much the new scenario will consume.\\n\\n### Domain Reports (continue)\\n\\nWe plan to release this internal feature to open source as soon as possible. On top of presenting this data on built-in Cadence surfaces (web, CLI. etc.) we will create APIs to make it integratable with deployment systems, user service UIs, periodic reports and any other service that would like to consume.\\n\\n### Non-determinism Detection Improvements (continue)\\n\\nWe have seen great reliability improvements and reduction in incidents with this feature on the user side last year. We continue to invest in this feature and make it available in open source as soon as possible.\\n\\n### Domain Migrations (continue)\\n\\nIn the next year, we plan to finish our seamless client based migration to be able to safely migrate domains from one cluster to another, one technology (even if it\u2019s not Cadence) to another and one cloud solution to another. There are only a few features left to achieve this.\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nDo you want to hear more about Cadence? Do you need help with your set-up or usage? Are you evaluating your options?

This change will not trigger non-deterministic error.\\n\\nAn Activity is the smallest unit of execution for Cadence and what happens inside activities are not recorded as historical events and therefore will not be replayed. In short, this change is deterministic and it is fine to modify logic inside activities.\\n\\n### Does changing the workflow definition trigger non-determinstic errors?\\n\\n<b>YES</b>. This is a very typical non-deterministic error.\\n\\nWhen a new workflow code change is deployed, Cadence will find if it is compatible with\\nCadence history. Changes to workflow definition will fail the replay process of Cadence\\nas it finds the new workflow definition imcompatible with previous historical events.\\n\\nHere is a list of common workflow definition changes.\\n- Changing workflow parameter counts\\n- Changing workflow parameter types\\n- Changing workflow return types\\n\\nThe following changes are not categorized as definition changes and therefore will not\\ntrigger non-deterministic errors.\\n- Changes of workflow return values\\n- Changing workflow parameter names as they are just positional\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Does changing activity definitions trigger non-determinstic errors?\\n\\n<b>YES</b>. Similar to workflow definition change, this is also a very typical non-deterministic error.\\n\\nActivities are also recorded and replayed by Cadence. Therefore, changes to activity must also be compatible with Cadence history. The following changes are common ones that trigger non-deterministic errors.\\n- Changing activity parameter counts\\n- Changing activity parameter types\\n- Changing activity return types\\n\\nAs activity paremeters are also positional, these two changes will NOT trigger non-deterministic errors.\\n- Changes of activity return values\\n- Changing activity parameter names\\n\\nActivity return values inside workflows are not recorded and replayed.\\n\\n### What changes inside workflows may potentially trigger non-deterministic errors?\\n\\nCadence records each execution of a workflow and activity execution inside each of them.Therefore, new changes must be compatible with execution orders inside the workflow. The following changes will fail the non-deterministic check.\\n\\n- Append another activity\\n- Delete an existing activity\\n- Reordering activities\\n\\nIf you really need to change the activity implementation based on new business requirements, you may consider using versioning your workflow.\\n\\n### Are Cadence signals replayed? If definition of signal is changed, will it trigger non-deterministic errors?\\n\\nYes. If a signal is used in a workflow, it becomes a critical component of your workflow. Because signals also involve I/O to your workflow, it is also recorded and replayed. Modifications on signal definitions or usage may yield to non-deterministic errors, for instance, changing return type of a signal.\\n\\n### If I have new business requirement and really need to change the definition of a workflow, what should I do?\\n\\nYou may introduce a new workflow registered to your worker and divert traffic to it or use versioning for your workflow.

A big thank you to Mantas for initiating this work and we hope to see the results of the community input soon!\\n\\n## iWF Deep Dive and More! ##\\n\\nDuring the last few months community member [Quanzheng Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prclqz/) has continued to share his thoughts about [iWF](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf), a layer implemented on top of Cadence. Since our last update iWF now has a[Python SDK](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-python-sdk). Long has been busy writing articles to share iWF tips and tricks as well as some general ideas about workflows and processes.  Links to Long\'s articles can be found below:\\n\\n- [iWF Deep Dive: workflowState+Durable Timer#1](https://medium.com/@qlong/iwf-deep-dive-workflowstate-durable-timer-1-0bb89e6d6fd4)\\n\\n- [Gotchas About SignalWithStart in Cadence/Temporal](https://medium.com/@qlong/gotchas-about-signalwithstart-in-cadence-temporal-c3783fe1cc2e)\\n\\n- [\\"Workflow\\" could be \\"Process\\" in WorkflowAsCode frameworks](https://medium.com/@qlong/workflow-could-be-process-in-workflowascode-frameworks-63dcb632c248)\\n\\n## New Go Samples for Cadence ##\\n\\nThe Cadence core team is deprecating the old samples for Go and replacing them with new version 2 (V2) samples. They have received a lot of feedback from the community that people are having trouble with old samples, so are in the process of publishing a completely new set of samples for Go.\\n\\nHere are some major changes to the new samples:\\n\\n- Easy to use the read - the new samples will be completely based on CLIs instead of running a binary. (This is consistent with current Cadence use experience)\\n- Simple and transparent worker configuration - the old samples did not provide user a clear demonstration about the relationship between the worker and workflow themselves\\n- The new samples will help you bootstrap your Cadence workflow faster and easier.\\n- More vivid and self-explanatory - instead of the traditional \\"HelloWorld\\"  type of samples, we want to make it more interesting and engaging. (Each sample will try to simulate a real-life use case to make them more understandable and fun to learn!)\\n\\nWe hope the community will enjoy these changes. If you have any questions or have new an idea for a new sample then please reach out to [Chris Qin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisqin0610).\\n\\nThe new Go samples can be found at:\\n-  https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples/tree/master/new_samples.\\n\\nNote that the old samples will be removed once the new samples are fully refreshed.\\n\\n## Cadence Retrospective ##\\n\\nWe are nearly at the end of another year and yes it has gone so fast!

However,\\nthe definition of a Cadence workflow must be deterministic because behind the scenes cadence uses event sourcing to construct\\nthe workflow state by replaying the historical events stored for this specific workflow. Introducing components that are not compatible\\nwith an existing running workflow will yield to non-deterministic errors and sometimes developers find it tricky to debug. Consider the\\nfollowing workflow that executes two activities.\\n\\n```go\\nfunc SampleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, data string) (string, error) {\\n    ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{\\n        ScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Minute,\\n        StartToCloseTimeout:    time.Minute,\\n    }\\n    ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)\\n    var result1 string\\n    err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)\\n    if err != nil {\\n        return \\"\\", err\\n    }\\n    var result2 string\\n    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityB, result1).Get(ctx, &result2)\\n    return result2, err\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIn this example, the workflow will execute ActivityA and Activity B in sequence. These activities may have other logics in background, such as polling long running operations or manipulate database reads or writes. Now if the developer replaces ActivityA with another activity ActivityC, a non-deterministic error could happen for an existing workflow. It is because the workflow expects results from ActivityA but since the definition of the workflow has been changed to use results from ActivityC, the workflow will fail due to failure of identifying history data of ActivityA. Such issues can be detected by introducing replayers and shadowers to the workflow unit tests.\\n\\nCadence workflow replayer is a testing component for replaying existing workflow histories against a workflow definition. You may think of replayer as a mock which will rerun your workflow with exactly the same history as your real workflow. The replaying logic is the same as the one used for processing workflow tasks. If it detects any incompatible changes, the replay test will fail.\\nWorkflow Replayer works well when verifying the compatibility against a small number of workflow histories. If there are lots of workflows in production that need to be verified, dumping all histories manually clearly won\'t work. Directly fetching histories from the cadence server might be a solution, but the time to replay all workflow histories might be too long for a test.\\n\\nWorkflow Shadower is built on top of Workflow Replayer to address this problem. The basic idea of shadowing is: scan workflows based on the filters you defined, fetch history for each workflow in the scan result from Cadence server and run the replay test. It can be run either as a test to serve local development purposes or as a workflow in your worker to continuously replay production workflows.\\n\\nYou may find detailed instructions on how to use replayers and shadowers on [our website](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/go-client/workflow-replay-shadowing/). We will introduce versioning in the next coming blogs."},{"id":"/2023/07/31/community-spotlight-july-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/31/community-spotlight-july-2023","editUrl":"https://github.com/cadence-workflow/Cadence-Docs/tree/master/blog/2023-07-31-community-spotlight-july-2023.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-31-community-spotlight-july-2023.md","title":"Cadence Community Spotlight Update - July 2023","description":"Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!","date":"2023-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Releases","permalink":"/blog/tags/releases","description":"Releases tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcements","description":"Announcement tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Community Spotlight","permalink":"/blog/tags/community-spotlights","description":"Community Spotlight tag description"}],"readingTime":2.49,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sharan Foga","title":"Director of Operations & Customer Success @ Encube Technologies","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sfoga/","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/sharanf"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sfoga/","github":"https://github.com/sharanf"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/sharanf.png","key":"sharanf"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Cadence Community Spotlight Update - July 2023","date":"2023-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","authors":"sharanf","tags":["release","announcement","community-spotlight"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Non-deterministic errors, replayers and shadowers","permalink":"/blog/2023/08/28/nondeterministic-errors-replayers-shadowers"},"nextItem":{"title":"Write your first workflow with Cadence","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/16/2023-07-16-write-your-first-workflow-with-cadence/write-your-first-workflow-with-cadence"}},"content":"Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!\\n\\nPlease see below for a roundup of the highlights:\\n\\n## Getting Started with Cadence ##\\n\\nAre you new to  Cadence and want to understand the basic concepts and architecture?

As diverse teams often encounter distinct business use cases, it becomes imperative to address the most frequently reported issues in Cadence workflows. To provide valuable insights and guidance, the Cadence team has meticulously compiled these common challenges based on customer feedback.\\n\\n* Reusing the same workflow ID for very active/continuous running workflows\\n\\nCadence organizes workflows based on their unique IDs, using a process called <b>partitioning</b>. If a workflow receives a large number of updates in a short period of time or frequently starts new runs using the `continueAsNew` function, all these updates will be directed to the same shard. Unfortunately, the Cadence backend is not equipped to handle this concentrated workload efficiently. As a result, a situation known as a \\"hot shard\\" arises, overloading the Cadence backend and worsening the problem.\\n\\nSolution:\\nWell, the best way to avoid this is simply just design your workflow in the way such that each workflow owns a uniformly distributed workflow ID across your Cadence domain. This will make sure that Cadence backend is able to evenly distribute the traffic with proper partition on your workflowIDs.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n* Excessive batch jobs or an enormous number of timers triggered at the same time\\n\\nCadence has the capability to handle a large number of concurrent tasks initiated simultaneously, but tampering with this feature can lead to issues within the Cadence system. Consider a scenario where millions of jobs are scheduled to start at the same time and are expected to finish within a specific time interval. Cadence faces the challenge of understanding the desired behavior of customers in such cases. It is uncertain whether the intention is to complete all jobs simultaneously, provide progressive updates in parallel, or finish all jobs before a given deadline. This ambiguity arises due to the independent nature of each job and the difficulty in predicting their outcomes.\\n\\nMoreover, Cadence workers utilize a sticky cache by default to optimize the runtime of workflows. However, when an overwhelming number of parallel workflows cannot fit into the cache, it can result in <b>cache thrashing</b>. This, in turn, leads to a quadratic increase in runtime complexity, specifically O(n^2), exacerbating the overall performance of the system.\\n\\nSolution:\\nThere are multiple ways to address this issue. Customers can either run jobs in a smaller batch or use start workflow jitter to randomly distribute timers within certain timeframe."},{"id":"/2023/07/05/implement-cadence-worker-from-scratch","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/07/05/implement-cadence-worker-from-scratch","editUrl":"https://github.com/cadence-workflow/Cadence-Docs/tree/master/blog/2023-07-05-implement-cadence-worker-from-scratch.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-05-implement-cadence-worker-from-scratch.md","title":"Implement a Cadence worker service from scratch","description":"In the previous blog, we have introduced three critical components for a Cadence application: the Cadence backend, domain, and worker.

Among these, the worker service is the most crucial focus for developers as it hosts the activities and workflows of a Cadence application. In this blog, I will provide a short tutorial on how to implement a simple worker service from scratch in Go.\\n\\nTo finish this tutorial, there are two prerequisites you need to finish first\\n1. Register a Cadence domain for your worker. For this tutorial, I\'ve already registered a domain named `test-domain`\\n2. Start the Cadence backend server in background.\\n\\nTo get started, let\'s simply use the native HTTP package built in Go to start a process listening to port 3000. You may customize the port for your worker, but the port you choose should not conflict with existing port for your Cadence backend.\\n\\n```go\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n\\t\\"fmt\\"\\n\\t\\"net/http\\"\\n)\\n\\nfunc main(){\\n\\tfmt.Println(\\"Cadence worker started at port 3000\\")\\n\\thttp.ListenAndServe(\\":3000\\", nil)\\n}\\n```\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nNext, let\'s define some basic configurations for the worker. In real production environment, you may need to implement them in configurational languages, but in this tutorial, let\'s just hard code them for now.\\n\\n```go\\nvar HostPort = \\"127.0.0.1:7933\\"\\nvar Domain = \\"test-domain\\"\\nvar TaskListName = \\"test-worker\\"\\nvar ClientName = \\"test-worker\\"\\nvar CadenceService = \\"cadence-frontend\\"\\n```\\n\\nNote that the domain is what we\'ve already registered in advance. We will need to use this domain to interact with Cadence CLI tool.\\n\\nThen let\'s write a simple function to build a Cadence client on gRPC in your worker, which will communicate with the Cadence backend continuously.\\n\\n```go\\nfunc buildCadenceClient() workflowserviceclient.Interface {\\n    dispatcher := yarpc.NewDispatcher(yarpc.Config{\\n\\t\\tName: ClientName,\\n\\t\\tOutbounds: yarpc.Outbounds{\\n\\t\\t  CadenceService: {Unary: grpc.NewTransport().NewSingleOutbound(HostPort)},\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t  })\\n\\t  if err := dispatcher.Start(); err != nil {\\n\\t\\tpanic(\\"Failed to start dispatcher\\")\\n\\t  }\\n\\n\\t  clientConfig := dispatcher.ClientConfig(CadenceService)\\n\\n\\t  return compatibility.NewThrift2ProtoAdapter(\\n\\t\\tapiv1.NewDomainAPIYARPCClient(clientConfig),\\n\\t\\tapiv1.NewWorkflowAPIYARPCClient(clientConfig),\\n\\t\\tapiv1.NewWorkerAPIYARPCClient(clientConfig),\\n\\t\\tapiv1.NewVisibilityAPIYARPCClient(clientConfig),\\n\\t  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s also build a logger to help us debug our application\\n\\n```go\\nfunc buildLogger() *zap.Logger {\\n    config := zap.NewDevelopmentConfig()\\n    config.Level.SetLevel(zapcore.InfoLevel)\\n\\n    var err error\\n    logger, err := config.Build()\\n    if err != nil {\\n        panic(\\"Failed to setup logger\\")\\n    }\\n\\n    return logger\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWith both client and logger helper function ready, let\'s write the function that starts our worker.\\n\\n```go\\nfunc startWorker(logger *zap.Logger, service workflowserviceclient.Interface) {\\n    // TaskListName identifies set of client workflows, activities, and workers.\\n    // It could be your group or client or application name.\\n    workerOptions := worker.Options{\\n        Logger:       logger,\\n        MetricsScope: tally.NewTestScope(TaskListName, map[string]string{}),\\n    }\\n\\n    worker := worker.New(\\n        service,\\n        Domain,\\n        TaskListName,\\n        workerOptions)\\n    err := worker.Start()\\n    if err != nil {\\n        panic(\\"Failed to start worker\\")\\n    }\\n\\n    logger.Info(\\"Started Worker.\\", zap.String(\\"worker\\", TaskListName))\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow we have all components ready for the worker, let\'s put them together.\\n\\n```Go\\nimport (\\n    \\"net/http\\"\\n    \\"go.uber.org/cadence/.gen/go/cadence/workflowserviceclient\\"\\n    \\"go.uber.org/cadence/compatibility\\"\\n    \\"go.uber.org/cadence/worker\\"\\n\\n    apiv1 \\"github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-idl/go/proto/api/v1\\"\\n    \\"github.com/uber-go/tally\\"\\n    \\"go.uber.org/zap\\"\\n    \\"go.uber.org/zap/zapcore\\"\\n    \\"go.uber.org/yarpc\\"\\n    \\"go.uber.org/yarpc/transport/grpc\\"\\n)\\n\\nvar HostPort = \\"127.0.0.1:7933\\"\\nvar Domain = \\"test-domain\\"\\nvar TaskListName = \\"test-worker\\"\\nvar ClientName = \\"test-worker\\"\\nvar CadenceService = \\"cadence-frontend\\"\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n    startWorker(buildLogger(), buildCadenceClient())\\n    http.ListenAndServe(\\":3000\\", nil)\\n}\\n\\nfunc buildLogger() *zap.Logger {\\n    config := zap.NewDevelopmentConfig()\\n    config.Level.SetLevel(zapcore.InfoLevel)\\n\\n    var err error\\n    logger, err := config.Build()\\n    if err != nil {\\n        panic(\\"Failed to setup logger\\")\\n    }\\n\\n    return logger\\n}\\n\\nfunc buildCadenceClient() workflowserviceclient.Interface {\\n    dispatcher := yarpc.NewDispatcher(yarpc.Config{\\n\\t\\tName: ClientName,\\n\\t\\tOutbounds: yarpc.Outbounds{\\n\\t\\t  CadenceService: {Unary: grpc.NewTransport().NewSingleOutbound(HostPort)},\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t  })\\n\\t  if err := dispatcher.Start();

This was exciting to hear! Some of you have contacted us to learn more about benchmarks, scale, and ideal use cases. We will share more guidelines about this but until then, feel free to contact us over our Slack workspace for guidance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![scale.png](./2023-survey-results/scale.png)\\n\\nThe scale our users operating Cadence varies from thousands to billions of workflows per month. It was exciting to see it being used in both small and large scale companies.\\n\\n![time_zone.png](./2023-survey-results/time_zone.png)\\n\\nMost survey responders were from Europe compared to any other place. This is in-line with the Cadence team growing its presence in Europe. Users from different places also contacted us to contribute to Cadence as a follow up to the survey. We will start putting up-for-grabs and new-starter tasks on Github. Several of them wanted to meet with a Zoom call and to discuss their use cases and best practices. As the Cadence team has presence in both the EU and the US, we welcome all our users to contact us anytime. Slack is the fastest way to reach us.\\n\\n![following.png](./2023-survey-results/following.png)\\n\\n![channels.png](./2023-survey-results/channels.png)\\n\\nCadence is followed in [Slack](https://uber-cadence.slack.com/) the most, then [Github](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cadenceworkflow/). We are the most active in Slack and we plan to be more active in other mediums as well.\\n\\n![scenarios.png](./2023-survey-results/scenarios.png)\\nAll of our main use cases were used across the board. While we mentioned the most common cases, several others were mentioned as a comment: enhanced timers, leader election etc.\\n\\nWe found out that Cadence has been used in several science communities. Some of them were using community built clients and were asking if we are going to support more languages. We are planning to take ownership of the Python and Javascript/Typescript clients and support them officially.\\n\\n![improvement.png](./2023-survey-results/improvement.png)\\n\\nDocumentation is by far what our users wanted improvements on. We are revamping our documentation soon and there will be major changes on our website soon.\\n\\n![help_stage.png](./2023-survey-results/help_stage.png)\\n\\nOther requests were about observability, debuggability, operability, and usability. These areas have been our main focus this year and we are planning to release updates and blogs about them.\\n\\n![support.png](./2023-survey-results/support.png)\\n\\nWe noticed most of our users need help once a month or more. While we welcome questions and discussions over the mediums mentioned above, we plan to make more public posts about the common issues using our blog, StackOverflow, LinkedIn, or Twitter.\\n\\nMany users wanted to hear more from Cadence about the roadmap and its growth. Our posts about these will be released soon. Expect more posts about upcoming features, investments, scale, and community updates. Follow us at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cadenceworkflow/) for such updates.\\n\\nOur users are interested in learning more about guidelines, capacity expectations in on-prem and in managed solutions. While we have been providing feedback per user basis before, we plan to release more generic guidelines with our observability updates mentioned above.\\n\\nWe also would like to thank our community for the increased interest and engagement with us! Cadence has been more active in different mediums (LinkedIn, Slack, blog, etc.) this year. In the first quarter, we observed that our user base and activities has almost doubled (+96% and +90% respectively) through both new and returning users. Based on such immediate positive reactions, we will keep increasing our community investments in different channels."},{"id":"/2023/03/31/community-spotlight-march-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/03/31/community-spotlight-march-2023","editUrl":"https://github.com/cadence-workflow/Cadence-Docs/tree/master/blog/2023-03-31-community-spotlight-march-2023.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-31-community-spotlight-march-2023.md","title":"Cadence Community Spotlight Update - March 2023","description":"Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!","date":"2023-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Community Spotlight","permalink":"/blog/tags/community-spotlights","description":"Community Spotlight tag description"}],"readingTime":1.885,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sharan Foga","title":"Director of Operations & Customer Success @ Encube Technologies","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sfoga/","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/sharanf"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sfoga/","github":"https://github.com/sharanf"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/sharanf.png","key":"sharanf"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Cadence Community Spotlight Update - March 2023","date":"2023-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","authors":"sharanf","tags":["community-spotlight"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"2023 Cadence Community Survey Results","permalink":"/blog/2023/06/08/2023-06-08-survey-results/survey-results"},"nextItem":{"title":"Cadence Community Spotlight Update - March 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/3/11/community-spotlight-update-march-2024"}},"content":"Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!\\n\\nPlease see below for a roundup of the highlights:\\n\\n## Cadence at Open Source Summit, North America ##\\nWe are very pleased to let you know that a talk on Cadence has been accepted for the Linux Foundation\'s [Open Source Summit, North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) in Vancouver on 10th - 12th May 2023.\\n\\nThe talk called [Cadence: The New Open Source Project for Building Complex Distributed Applications](https://ossna2023.sched.com/event/1K5B1) will be given by [Ender Demirkaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enderdemirkaya/) and [Emrah Seker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emrahseker/) If you are planning to attend the Open Source Summit then please don\'t forget to attend the talk and take time catch up with Ender and Emrah!\\n\\n## Community Activity ##\\nOur Slack #support channel has been very active over the last few months as we continue to get an continual stream of questions.

It offers features such as authentication and streaming that are very relevant for Cadence. Moreover, TChannel is being deprecated within Uber itself, pushing an effort for this migration. During the last year we\u2019ve implemented multiple changes in server and SDK that allows users to use gRPC in Cadence, as well as to upgrade their existing Cadence cluster in a backward compatible way. This post tracks the completed work items and our future plans.\\n\\n## Our Approach\\nWith ~500 services using Cadence at Uber and many more open source customers around the world, we had to think about the gRPC transition in a backwards compatible way. We couldn\u2019t simply flip transport and encoding everywhere. Instead we needed to support both protocols as an intermediate step to ensure a smooth transition for our users.\\n\\nCadence was using Thrift/TChannel not just for the API with client SDKs. They were also used for RPC calls between internal Cadence server components and also between different data centers. When starting this migration we had a choice of either starting with public APIs first or all the internal things within the server. We chose the latter one, so that we could gain experience and iterate faster within the server without disruption to the clients. With server side done and listening for both protocols, dynamic config flag was exposed to switch traffic internally. It allowed gradual deployment and provided an option to rollback if needed.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe next step - client migration. We have more users for the Go SDK at Uber, that is why we started with it. Current version of SDK exposes Thrift types via public API, therefore we can not remove them without breaking changes. While we have plans for revamped v2 SDK, current users are able to use gRPC as well - with the help of a [translation adapter](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-go-client/blob/v0.18.2/compatibility/thrift2proto.go). Migration is underway starting with [cadence canary service](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/tree/master/canary), and then onboarding user services one by one.\\n\\nWe plan to support TChannel for a few more releases and then eventually drop it in a future.\\n\\n## System overview\\n![gRPC migration overview](./grpc-migration.svg)\\n\\n1. The frontend of [Cadence Server](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence) exposes two inbounds for both gRPC and TChannel starting [v0.21.0 release](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.21.0). gRPC traffic is being served on a different port that can be configured [here](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/v0.21.0/config/development.yaml#L25). For gRPC API we introduced [proto IDL](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-idl/tree/master/proto/cadence-workflow/cadence/api/v1) definitions. We will keep TChannel open on frontend for some time to allow gradual client migration.\\n2. Starting with [v0.21.0](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.21.0) internal components of Cadence Server (history & matching) also started accepting gRPC traffic. Sending traffic via gRPC is off by default and could be enabled with a flag in [dynamic config](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/v0.21.0/config/dynamicconfig/development.yaml#L10). Planned for v0.24.0 it will be enabled by default, with an option to opt-out.\\n3. Starting with v0.23.0 communication between different Cadence clusters can be switched to gRPC via this [configuration](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/0.23.x/config/development_active.yaml#L82). It is used for replication and request redirection to different DC.\\n4. [Go SDK](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-go-client) has exposed generated Thrift types via its public API. This complicated migration, because switching them to proto types (or rpc agnostic types) means breaking changes. Because of this we are pursuing two alternatives:\\n    1. (A) Short term: starting with [v0.18.2](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-go-client/releases/tag/v0.18.2) a [compatibility layer](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-go-client/blob/v0.18.2/compatibility/thrift2proto.go) is available which makes translation between thrift-proto types underneath. It allows using gRPC communication while still using Thrift based API. [Usage example](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples/pull/52).\\n    2. (B) Long term: we are currently designing v2 SDK that will support gRPC directly. Its API will be RPC agnostic and will include other usability improvements. You can check some ideas that are being considered [here](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-go-client/issues/1133).\\n5. [Java SDK](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-client) is currently on TChannel only. Move to gRPC is planned for 2022 H1.\\n6. It is now possible to communicate with gRPC from other languages as well. Use [proto IDLs](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-idl/tree/master/proto/cadence-workflow/cadence/api/v1) to generate bindings for your preferred language. [Minimal example](https://github.com/vytautas-karpavicius/cadence-python) for doing it in python.\\n7. WebUI and CLI are currently on TChannel. They are planned to be switched to gRPC for 2022 H1.\\n\\n## Migration steps\\n### Upgrading Cadence server\\nIn order to start using gRPC please upgrade Cadence server to **[v0.22.0](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/releases/tag/v0.22.0) or later**.\\n1. If you are using an older version (before v0.21.0), make sure to disable internal gRPC communication at first. Needed to ensure that all nodes in the cluster are ready to accept gRPC traffic, before switching it on. This is controlled by the [system.enableGRPCOutbound](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/v0.21.0/config/dynamicconfig/development.yaml#L10) flag in dynamic config.\\n2. Once deployed, flip system.enableGRPCOutbound to true. It will require a cluster restart for setting to take effect.\\n3. If you are operating in more than one DC - recommended server version to upgrade to is v0.23.0 or newer. Once individual clusters with gRPC support are deployed, please update [config](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/0.23.x/config/development_active.yaml#L82) to switch cross DC traffic to gRPC. Don\u2019t forget to update ports as well. We also recommend increasing [grpcMaxMsgSize](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/0.23.x/config/development.yaml#L29) to 32MB which is needed to ensure smooth replication. After config change you will need a restart for setting to take effect.\\n4. Do not forget that gRPC runs on a different port, therefore you might need to open it on docker containers, firewalls, etc.\\n\\n### Upgrading clients\\n1. GoSDK - Follow an [example](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples/pull/52) to inject Thrift-to-proto adapter during client initialization and update your config to use the gRPC port.\\n\\n### Status at Uber\\n* All clusters run gRPC traffic internally for 4 months without any issues.\\n* Cross DC traffic has been switched to gRPC this month.\\n* With internal tooling updated, we are starting to onboard services to use the Go SDK gRPC compatibility layer.\\n\\n---\\nDo not hesitate to reach out to us ([cadence-oss@googlegroups.com](mailto:cadence-oss@googlegroups.com)\xa0or\xa0[slack](http://t.uber.com/cadence-slack)) if you have any questions.\\n\\nThe Uber Cadence team"},{"id":"/2021/10/13/announcing-cadence-oss-office-hours-and-community-sync-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/10/13/announcing-cadence-oss-office-hours-and-community-sync-up","editUrl":"https://github.com/cadence-workflow/Cadence-Docs/tree/master/blog/2021-10-13-announcing-cadence-oss-office-hours-and-community-sync-up.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-13-announcing-cadence-oss-office-hours-and-community-sync-up.md","title":"Announcing Cadence OSS office hours and community sync up","description":"Are you a current Cadence user, do you operate Cadence services, or are you interested in learning about workflow technologies and wonder what problems Cadence could solve for you?

This message caused some confusion in the community, so we would like to take this opportunity to clear things out.\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, **Uber is committed to the long-term success of the Cadence project**. Since its inception 5 years ago, use cases built on Cadence and their scale have grown significantly at Uber. Today, Cadence powers a variety of our most business-critical use cases (some public stories are available [here](https://eng.uber.com/hadoop-container-blog/) and [here](https://eng.uber.com/meet-sao-paulo-tech/)). At the same time, the Cadence development team at Uber has enjoyed rapid growth with the product and has been driving innovations of workflow technology across the board, from new features (e.g. [graceful failover](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/pulls?q=is%3Apr+graceful+failover), [workflow shadowing](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/java-client/workflow-replay-shadowing/#workflow-replayer), [UI improvements](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-web/commits/master)) to better engineering foundations (e.g. [gRPC support](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/pulls?q=is%3Apr+grpc), [multi-tenancy support](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22cadence+multi-tenancy%22+)), all in a backwards compatible manner. Neither Uber\u2019s use nor support of Cadence is going to change with Temporal\u2019s announcement. We have a long list of features and exciting roadmaps ahead of us, and we will share more details in our next meetup in November \u201821. As always we will continue to push the boundaries of scale and reliability as our usage within Uber grows.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nSecondly, **we are committed to maintaining and growing a healthy and collaborative community**. Cadence continues to attract attention as a [popular open source platform](https://star-history.t9t.io/#cadence-workflow/cadence), with more than 100 contributors to our project, and more than 1500 developers in our [open source Slack support channel](https://t.uber.com/cadence-slack). The Uber Cadence team, along with our open source partners like [Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prclqz/) from Indeed, have been behind the management and support of the Cadence open source community for the past 2 years. Moving forward, we are going to work even more closely with our community, through a series of online and offline channels including meetups, office hours, tech deep dives, and design consultations. We would also like to scale the way we operate, by creating a **Cadence OSS Committee** that allows us to maintain a closer relationship with its members, so that we can learn from each other\'s Cadence experiences and grow together. Please definitely let us know your suggestions on the type of engagements that you would like to see with the core team.\\n\\n\\n**About Temporal and its \u201cEOL announcement\u201d**\\n\\nTemporal is a startup that was started 2 years ago based on a Cadence fork by some of the original Cadence team members. We are always grateful for their original contribution to the Cadence project and wish them the best of luck in their future endeavours. That said the announcement from Temporal only means that their team will focus on Temporal (which has always been the case for the last 2 years), and not an official stance on Cadence since they have not been involved with the project for quite some time now.\\n\\n\\nFeel free to reach out to us ([cadence-oss@googlegroups.com](mailto:cadence-oss@googlegroups.com) or [slack](http://t.uber.com/cadence-slack)) if you have any questions. And we look forward to your contribution and collaboration.\\n\\n\\nThe Uber Cadence team"}]}}')}}]);
