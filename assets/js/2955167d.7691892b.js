It is because the workflow expects results from ActivityA but since the definition of the workflow has been changed to use results from ActivityC, the workflow will fail due to failure of identifying history data of ActivityA.

You may think of replayer as a mock which will rerun your workflow with exactly the same history as your real workflow. The replaying logic is the same as the one used for processing workflow tasks. If it detects any incompatible changes, the replay test will fail.\nWorkflow Replayer works well when verifying the compatibility against a small number of workflow histories.
