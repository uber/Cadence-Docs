An application process would periodically scan database tables for customers in specific states, execute necessary actions, and update the state to reflect that.

For example, charging a credit card or sending emails can fail due to a downstream system unavailability. The failed calls might need to be retried for a long time, ideally using an exponential retry policy. These calls should be throttled to not overload external systems.
