# Command Line Interface

The Cadence :CLI: is a command-line tool you can use to perform various :task:tasks: on a Cadence server. It can perform
:domain: operations such as register, update, and describe as well as :workflow: operations like start
:workflow:, show :workflow: history, and :signal: :workflow:.

## Using the CLI

### Homebrew
```
brew install cadence-workflow
```

After the installation is done, you can use CLI:
```
cadence --help
```
This will always install the latest version. Follow [this instructions](https://github.com/uber/cadence/discussions/4457) if you need to install older versions of Cadence CLI. 

### Docker
The Cadence :CLI: can be used directly from the Docker Hub image *ubercadence/cli* or by building the :CLI: tool
locally.

Example of using the docker image to describe a :domain::
```bash
docker run -it --rm ubercadence/cli:master --address <frontendAddress> --domain samples-domain domain describe
```

`master` will be the latest CLI binary from the project. But you can specify a version to best match your server version:
```bash
docker run -it --rm ubercadence/cli:<version> --address <frontendAddress> --domain samples-domain domain describe
```
For example `docker run --rm ubercadence/cli:0.21.3 --domain samples-domain domain describe` will be the CLI that is released as part of the [v0.21.3 release](https://github.com/uber/cadence/releases/tag/v0.21.3). 
See [docker hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/ubercadence/cli/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) for all the CLI image tags. 
Note that CLI versions of 0.20.0 works for all server versions of 0.12 to 0.19 as well. That's because [the CLI version doesn't change in those versions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68217385/what-is-clientversionnotsupportederror-and-how-to-resolve-it). 

NOTE: On Docker versions 18.03 and later, you may get a "connection refused" error when connecting to local server. You can work around this by setting the host to "host.docker.internal" (see [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds) for more info).

```bash
docker run -it --rm ubercadence/cli:master --address host.docker.internal:7933 --domain samples-domain domain describe
```

NOTE: Be sure to update your image when you want to try new features: `docker pull ubercadence/cli:master `

NOTE: If you are running docker-compose Cadence server, you can also logon to the container to execute CLI:
```
docker exec -it docker_cadence_1 /bin/bash

# cadence --address $(hostname -i):7933 --do samples domain register
```

### Build it yourself 
To build the :CLI: tool locally, clone the [Cadence server repo](https://github.com/uber/cadence), check out the version tag (e.g. `git checkout v0.21.3`) and run
`make tools`. This produces an executable called `cadence`. With a local build, the same command to
describe a :domain: would look like this:
```bash
cadence --domain samples-domain domain describe
```

Alternatively, you can build the CLI image, see [instructions](docker/README.md#diy-building-an-image-for-any-tag-or-branch) 

## Documentation

And etc.

The example commands below will use `cadence` for brevity.

## Environment variables

Setting environment variables for repeated parameters can shorten the :CLI: commands.

- **CADENCE_CLI_ADDRESS** - host:port for Cadence frontend service, the default is for the local server
- **CADENCE_CLI_DOMAIN** - default :workflow: :domain:, so you don't need to specify `--domain`

## Quick Start
Run `cadence` for help on top level commands and global options
Run `cadence domain` for help on :domain: operations
Run `cadence workflow` for help on :workflow: operations
Run `cadence tasklist` for help on tasklist operations
(`cadence help`, `cadence help [domain|workflow]` will also print help messages)

**Note:** make sure you have a Cadence server running before using :CLI:

### Domain operation examples
- Register a new :domain: named "samples-domain":
```bash
cadence --domain samples-domain domain register
# OR using short alias
cadence --do samples-domain d re 
```
If your Cadence cluster has enable [global domain(XDC replication)](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/concepts/cross-dc-replication/), then you have to specify the replicaiton settings when registering a domain:
```bash
cadence --domains amples-domain domain register --active_cluster clusterNameA --clusters clusterNameA clusterNameB
```

- View "samples-domain" details:
```bash
cadence --domain samples-domain domain describe
```

### Workflow operation examples
The following examples assume the CADENCE_CLI_DOMAIN environment variable is set.

#### Run workflow
Start a :workflow: and see its progress. This command doesn't finish until :workflow: completes.
```bash
cadence workflow run --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.Workflow --et 60 -i '"cadence"'

# view help messages for workflow run
cadence workflow run -h
```
Brief explanation:
To run a :workflow:, the user must specify the following:
1. Tasklist name (--tl)
2. Workflow type (--wt)
3. Execution start to close timeout in seconds (--et)
4. Input in JSON format (--i) (optional)

s example uses [this cadence-samples workflow](https://github.com/uber-common/cadence-samples/blob/master/cmd/samples/recipes/helloworld/helloworld_workflow.go)
and takes a string as input with the `-i '"cadence"'` parameter. Single quotes (`''`) are used to wrap input as JSON.

**Note:** You need to start the :worker: so that the :workflow: can make progress.
(Run `make && ./bin/helloworld -m worker` in cadence-samples to start the :worker:)

#### Show running workers of a tasklist
```bash
cadence tasklist desc --tl helloWorldGroup
```

#### Start workflow
```bash
cadence workflow start --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.Workflow --et 60 -i '"cadence"'

# view help messages for workflow start
cadence workflow start -h

# for a workflow with multiple inputs, separate each json with space/newline like
cadence workflow start --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.WorkflowWith3Args --et 60 -i '"your_input_string" 123 {"Name":"my-string", "Age":12345}'
```
The :workflow: `start` command is similar to the `run` command, but immediately returns the workflow_id and
run_id after starting the :workflow:. Use the `show` command to view the :workflow:'s history/progress.

##### Reuse the same workflow id when starting/running a workflow

Use option `--workflowidreusepolicy` or `--wrp` to configure the :workflow_ID: reuse policy.
**Option 0 AllowDuplicateFailedOnly:** Allow starting a :workflow_execution: using the same :workflow_ID: when a :workflow: with the same :workflow_ID: is not already running and the last execution close state is one of *[terminated, cancelled, timedout, failed]*.
**Option 1 AllowDuplicate:** Allow starting a :workflow_execution: using the same :workflow_ID: when a :workflow: with the same :workflow_ID: is not already running.
**Option 2 RejectDuplicate:** Do not allow starting a :workflow_execution: using the same :workflow_ID: as a previous :workflow:.
```bash
# use AllowDuplicateFailedOnly option to start a workflow
cadence workflow start --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.Workflow --et 60 -i '"cadence"' --wid "<duplicated workflow id>" --wrp 0

# use AllowDuplicate option to run a workflow
cadence workflow run --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.Workflow --et 60 -i '"cadence"' --wid "<duplicated workflow id>" --wrp 1
```

##### Start a workflow with a memo
Memos are immutable key/value pairs that can be attached to a :workflow: run when starting the :workflow:. These are
visible when listing :workflow:workflows:. More information on memos can be found
[here](/docs/concepts/search-workflows/#memo-vs-search-attributes).
```bash
cadence wf start -tl helloWorldGroup -wt main.Workflow -et 60 -i '"cadence"' -memo_key ‘“Service” “Env” “Instance”’ -memo ‘“serverName1” “test” 5’
```

#### Show workflow history
```bash
cadence workflow show -w 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717 -r 866ae14c-88cf-4f1e-980f-571e031d71b0
# a shortcut of this is (without -w -r flag)
cadence workflow showid 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717 866ae14c-88cf-4f1e-980f-571e031d71b0

# if run_id is not provided, it will show the latest run history of that workflow_id
cadence workflow show -w 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717
# a shortcut of this is
cadence workflow showid 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717
```

#### Show workflow execution information
```bash
cadence workflow describe -w 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717 -r 866ae14c-88cf-4f1e-980f-571e031d71b0
# a shortcut of this is (without -w -r flag)
cadence workflow describeid 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717 866ae14c-88cf-4f1e-980f-571e031d71b0

# if run_id is not provided, it will show the latest workflow execution of that workflow_id
cadence workflow describe -w 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717
# a shortcut of this is
cadence workflow describeid 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717
```

#### List closed or open workflow executions
```bash
cadence workflow list

# default will only show one page, to view more items, use --more flag
cadence workflow list -m
```

Use **--query** to list :workflow:workflows: with SQL like :query::

```bash
cadence workflow list --query "WorkflowType='main.SampleParentWorkflow' AND CloseTime = missing "
```

This will return all open :workflow:workflows: with workflowType as "main.SampleParentWorkflow".

#### Query workflow execution
```bash
# use custom query type
cadence workflow query -w <wid> -r <rid> --qt <query-type>

# use build-in query type "__stack_trace" which is supported by Cadence client library
cadence workflow query -w <wid> -r <rid> --qt __stack_trace
# a shortcut to query using __stack_trace is (without --qt flag)
cadence workflow stack -w <wid> -r <rid>
# a shortcut to query using __query_types (without --qt flag) to list all available query types
cadence workflow query-types -w <wid> -r <rid>
```

#### Signal, cancel, terminate workflow
```bash
# signal
cadence workflow signal -w <wid> -r <rid> -n <signal-name> -i '"signal-value"'

# cancel
cadence workflow cancel -w <wid> -r <rid>

# terminate
cadence workflow terminate -w <wid> -r <rid> --reason
```
Terminating a running :workflow_execution: will record a WorkflowExecutionTerminated :event: as the closing :event: in the history. No more :decision_task:decision_tasks: will be scheduled for a terminated :workflow_execution:.
Canceling a running :workflow_execution: will record a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested :event: in the history, and a new :decision_task: will be scheduled. The :workflow: has a chance to do some clean up work after cancellation.

#### Signal, cancel, terminate workflows as a batch job
Batch job is based on List Workflow Query(**--query**). It supports :signal:, cancel and terminate as batch job type.
For terminating :workflow:workflows: as batch job, it will terminte the children recursively.

Start a batch job(using :signal: as batch type):
```bash
cadence --do samples-domain wf batch start --query "WorkflowType='main.SampleParentWorkflow' AND CloseTime=missing" --reason "test" --bt signal --sig testname
This batch job will be operating on 5 workflows.
Please confirm[Yes/No]:yes
{
    "jobID": "<batch-job-id>",
    "msg": "batch job is started"
}

```
You need to remember the JobID or use List command to get all your batch jobs:
```bash
cadence --do samples-domain wf batch list
```

Describe the progress of a batch job:
```bash
cadence --do samples-domain wf batch desc -jid <batch-job-id>
```
Terminate a batch job:
```bash
cadence --do samples-domain wf batch terminate -jid <batch-job-id>
```
Note that the operation performed by a batch will not be rolled back by terminating the batch. However, you can use reset to rollback your :workflow:workflows:.

#### Restart, reset workflow
The Reset command allows resetting a :workflow: to a particular point and continue running from there.
There are a lot of use cases:
- Rerun a failed :workflow: from the beginning with the same start parameters.
- Rerun a failed :workflow: from the failing point without losing the achieved progress(history).
- After deploying new code, reset an open :workflow: to let the :workflow: run to different flows.

You can reset to some predefined :event: types:
```bash
cadence workflow reset -w <wid> -r <rid> --reset_type <reset_type> --reason "some_reason"
```

- FirstDecisionCompleted: reset to the beginning of the history.
- LastDecisionCompleted: reset to the end of the history.
- LastContinuedAsNew: reset to the end of the history for the previous run.

If you are familiar with the Cadence history :event:, You can also reset to any :decision: finish :event: by using:
```bash
cadence workflow reset -w <wid> -r <rid> --event_id <decision_finish_event_id> --reason "some_reason"
```
Some things to note:
- When reset, a new run will be kicked off with the same workflowID. But if there is a running execution for the workflow(workflowID), the current run will be terminated.
- decision_finish_event_id is the ID of :event:events: of the type: DecisionTaskComplete/DecisionTaskFailed/DecisionTaskTimeout.
- To restart a :workflow: from the beginning, reset to the first :decision_task: finish :event:.

To reset multiple :workflow:workflows:, you can use batch reset command:
```bash
cadence workflow reset-batch --input_file <file_of_workflows_to_reset> --reset_type <reset_type> --reason "some_reason"
```
#### Recovery from bad deployment -- auto-reset workflow
If a bad deployment lets a :workflow: run into a wrong state, you might want to reset the :workflow: to the point that the bad deployment started to run. But usually it is not easy to find out all the :workflow:workflows: impacted, and every reset point for each :workflow:. In this case, auto-reset will automatically reset all the :workflow:workflows: given a bad deployment identifier.

Let's get familiar with some concepts. Each deployment will have an identifier, we call it "**Binary Checksum**" as it is usually generated by the md5sum of a binary file. For a :workflow:, each binary checksum will be associated with an **auto-reset point**, which contains a **runID**, an **eventID**, and the **created_time** that binary/deployment made the first :decision: for the :workflow:.

To find out which **binary checksum** of the bad deployment to reset, you should be aware of at least one :workflow: running into a bad state. Use the describe command with **--reset_points_only** option to show all the reset points:
```bash
cadence wf desc -w <WorkflowID>  --reset_points_only
+----------------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------+
|         BINARY CHECKSUM          |          CREATE TIME           |                RUNID                 | EVENTID |
+----------------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------+
| c84c5afa552613a83294793f4e664a7f | 2019-05-24 10:01:00.398455019  | 2dd29ab7-2dd8-4668-83e0-89cae261cfb1 |       4 |
| aae748fdc557a3f873adbe1dd066713f | 2019-05-24 11:01:00.067691445  | d42d21b8-2adb-4313-b069-3837d44d6ce6 |       4 |
...
...
```

Then use this command to tell Cadence to auto-reset all :workflow:workflows: impacted by the bad deployment. The command will store the bad binary checksum into :domain: info and trigger a process to reset all your :workflow:workflows:.
```bash
cadence --do <YourDomainName> domain update --add_bad_binary aae748fdc557a3f873adbe1dd066713f  --reason "rollback bad deployment"
```

As you add the bad binary checksum to your :domain:, Cadence will not dispatch any :decision_task:decision_tasks: to the bad binary. So make sure that you have rolled back to a good deployment(or roll out new bits with bug fixes). Otherwise your :workflow: can't make any progress after auto-reset.
