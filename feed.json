            "summary": "At Uber, we run several big multitenant Cadence clusters with hundreds of domains in each. The clusters being multi-tenant means potential noisy neighbor effects between domains.\n\nAn essential aspect of avoiding this is managing how workflows interact with our infrastructure to prevent any single workflow from causing instability for the whole cluster. To this end, we are excited to introduce Workflow ID-based rate limits — a new feature designed to protect our clusters from problematic workflows and ensure stability across the board.\n\nWhy Workflow ID-based Rate Limits?\nWe already have rate limits for how many requests can be sent to a domain. However, since Cadence is sharded on the workflow ID, a user-provided input, an overused workflow with a particular id might overwhelm a shard by making too many requests. There are two main ways this happens:\n\nA user starts, or signals the ...",

            "summary": "If you haven’t heard about Cadence, this section is for you. In a short description, Cadence is a code-driven workflow orchestration engine. The definition itself may not tell enough, so it would help splitting it into three parts:\n\nWhat’s a workflow? (everyone has a different definition)\nWhy does it matter to be code-driven?\nBenefits of Cadence\n\nWhat is a Workflow?\n\nworkflow.png\n\nIn the simplest definition, it is “a multi-step execution”. Step here represents individual operations that are a little heavier than small in-process function calls. Although they are not limited to those: it could be a separate service call, processing a large dataset, map-reduce, thread sleep, scheduling next run, waiting for an external input, starting a sub workflow etc. It’s anything a user thinks as a single unit of logic in their code. Those steps often have dependencies among themselves. Some steps, including the very first step, might ...",

This change will not trigger non-deterministic error.\n\nAn Activity is the smallest unit of execution for Cadence and what happens inside activities are not recorded as historical events and therefore will not be replayed. In short, this change is deterministic and it is fine to modify logic inside activities.\n\nDoes changing the workflow definition trigger non-determinstic errors?\n\nYES. This is a very typical non-deterministic error.\n\nWhen a new workflow code change is deployed, Cadence will find if it is compatible with\nCadence history.
