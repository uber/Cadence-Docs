            <description><![CDATA[NO. This change will not trigger non-deterministic error.

An Activity is the smallest unit of execution for Cadence and what happens inside activities are not recorded as historical events and therefore will not be replayed. In short, this change is deterministic and it is fine to modify logic inside activities.

Does changing the workflow definition trigger non-determinstic errors?

YES. This is a very typical non-deterministic error.

When a new workflow code change is deployed, Cadence will find if it is compatible with
Cadence history. Changes to workflow definition will fail the replay process of Cadence
as it finds the new workflow definition imcompatible with previous historical events.

Here is a list of common workflow definition changes.
Changing workflow parameter counts
Changing workflow parameter types
Changing workflow return types

The following changes are not categorized as definition changes and therefore will not
trigger non-deterministic e ...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[It is conceivable that developers constantly update their Cadence workflow code based upon new business use cases and needs. However,
the definition of a Cadence workflow must be deterministic because behind the scenes cadence uses event sourcing to construct
the workflow state by replaying the historical events stored for this specific workflow. Introducing components that are not compatible
with an existing running workflow will yield to non-deterministic errors and sometimes developers find it tricky to debug. Consider the
following workflow that executes two activities.

func SampleWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, data string) (string, error) {
    ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{
        ScheduleToStartTimeout: time.Minute,
        StartToCloseTimeout:    time.Minute,
    }
    ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)
    var result1 string
    err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, ActivityA, data).Get(ctx, &result1)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
